A software solution to reducing error in wheel slippage is to reduce the speed at which the robot moves, but this becomes an issue when time is important. Use of an additional sensor such as the light sensor to aid in determining the robots position is a hardware solution. Reducing the speed of the robot will reduce the error in odometry because wheel slippage causes the odometer to increment when the robot is not actually moving. When the wheels are rotating slower, there is more static friction between the wheels and the ground and less kinetic or sliding friction. Because static friction is stronger than kinetic friction moving fast induces more error. Wheel slippage can cause linear and angular error. Linear error (in the x and y coordinates is not a big deal because it is small and does not affect the odometer’s accuracy as the robot continues to move. However, angular error (where there is slippage in one wheel that introduces error in the direction the robot thinks it is facing) can be more serious because the odometer then extrapolates the robot’s position as it moves forward, incrementing x and y by the wrong amount because the recorded theta is incorrect. However, if reduced speed is not practical, the use of the light sensor to correct angular is a very effective solution. The robot is able to correct theta with a single light sensor by remembering when it crosses a line, determining based on its knowledge of the distance between lines when it should detect the next line, and using trigonometry to determine the error in theta. This and the method using two light sensors was described in detail in the previous lab report.
